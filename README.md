### 🌷 about me

hi, i’m **asya** — a computer science student based in the netherlands 🇳🇱.  
i study systems programming, software engineering, and all the ✨invisible layers✨ that make computers *do things*.

i spend most of my time in linux, building little things in c, exploring compilers, debugging tools, and poking at binaries until they tell me their secrets.

i like small tools, clean code, and a well-behaved terminal 💻

---

### 💻 things i’m into

- 🧩 writing small, dependency-light c/c++ programs  
- 🔧 exploring linux internals + process behavior  
- 🌱 learning rust (vibes: safety + control)  
- 🧵 building command-line tools just for fun  
- 🔍 reading objdump like it's poetry  
- 🛠️ scripting everything with bash + make

---

### 🎀 soft tech stack

- 🧠 **languages**: c • c++ • rust (learning) • python • bash  
- 🛠️ **tools**: linux • gdb • lldb • make • cmake • valgrind  
- 💻 **editor setup**: vscode + terminal (pastel theme ofc)  
- 🎐 **desktop vibe**: tiling wm + minimal configs + pink accents

### 📓 personal notes

- 3rd year cs student slowly specializing in systems dev  
- my dotfiles are prettier than my actual wardrobe  
- i write tiny elf binaries that do exactly one thing  
- markdown is my second language (i journal everything)  
- debugging is ✨kind of fun✨ when you're in the mood  
- i like understanding stuff that's not supposed to be obvious  

---

### 📌 current focus

- 🐧 **memory safety + segmentation**  
- 🧃 **low-level debugging** (gdb, lldb, etc)  
- 🌱 **rust + borrow checker brain training**  
- 🦴 **binary formats (esp. elf) and how to work with them**  

---

### 📖 this week i learned

- 📚 diving into rust’s ownership model (still having fun with the borrow checker)  
- 🎯 experimenting with stack vs. heap memory management and what that really means  
- 🧩 had a blast writing a small ELF parser in python (it works! kind of…)  

---

### 🤔 what’s on my mind

- ☕ considering switching to zsh, but need more custom aliases first  
- 🎶 really into lofi beats + ambient music for focus lately  
- 💭 how can i optimize this one line of bash code…? it’s been bothering me
